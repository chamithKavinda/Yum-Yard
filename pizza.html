        <h1>Classic Pizza Recipe</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                <p>In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. Add 2 cups of flour, olive oil, and salt. Mix until the dough begins to come together.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong>
                <p>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough, gradually adding the remaining flour, until it is smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong>
                <p>Punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into two equal portions. On a floured surface, stretch and shape each portion into a round pizza crust.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong>
                <p>Place the dough on a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the crust. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
                <p>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone). Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <p>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</p>
